# byow
A 2D-tile based game with random world generation. This is a project I worked on for the class CS61B: Data Structures. I wrote most of the code found in `proj3/byow/Core`. This includes random world generation of rooms and hallways, saving and loading the world, player movement, and a limited-view mode.
