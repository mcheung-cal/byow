# byow
A 2D-tile based game with random world generation. This is a project I worked on with Jessica Dong for the class CS61B: Data Structures. I wrote most of the code found in `proj3/byow/Core`. This includes random world generation of rooms and hallways, saving and loading the world, player movement, a limited-view mode, avatar naming, and a heads-up display (HUD). 

# How to Play
Run `proj3/byow/Core/Main` and follow the instructions on the screen. 

Controls: 
- W: Up
- A: Down
- S: Left
- D: Right
- Mouse cursor: If you hover over a tile, the HUD in the top left will tell you what type of tile it is.  

When in-game, press `:q` or `:Q` to quit and save. When you open up the game and press `L`, the game should load the game that you just quit-saved.
